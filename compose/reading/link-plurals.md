# Link 1983 · The Logical Analysis of Plurals and Mass Terms

Companion to Godehard Link, "The logical analysis of plurals and mass terms:
A lattice-theoretical approach" (in Bäuerle, Schwarze & von Stechow (eds.),
*Meaning, Use, and Interpretation of Language*, de Gruyter, 1983). The
original is not freely available, so the definitions below are quoted from
Champollion & Krifka (2016), "Mereology" (*The Cambridge Handbook of Formal
Semantics*, ch. 13), cited by their numbering. Prose that is not quoted is
signposting or a flagged rendering note. The operators ∗, ⊕, ≤ are the same
ones as in the §10 worksheets.

## 1 Sums and conjoined terms

Champollion & Krifka's (9): "Definition Binary sum: x⊕y = ιz sum(z, {x, y}). For
example, the meaning of the term John and Mary can be written as j⊕m." The
proposal is Link's: "Link (1983) proposes to represent the denotation of the
conjoined term John and Mary as the sum of the individual John with the
individual Mary." Their (10): "Definition Generalized sum: For any nonempty set
P, its sum ⊕P is defined as ιz sum(z,P). For example, the meaning of the term
the water can be written as ⊕water"; the latter credits Sharvy (1980).

Rendering note: the worksheet's *and* between terms is λy.λz.z⊕y, and collective
predicates (*met*, *carried the piano*) apply to the sum individual directly.

## 2 Plurals as algebraic closure

Cumulative reference, their (16): "CUM(P) ⇔ ∀x∀y[P(x) ∧ P(y) → P(x⊕y)]", with
Link's slogan as they quote it: "if you add some horses to some other horses
then you again get some horses (Link, 1983)". Their (21): "Definition Algebraic
closure: If set P is nonempty, *P = {x|∃P′ ⊆ P[x=⊕P′]}. (The algebraic closure
of a set P is the set that contains any sum of things taken from P.)" Their toy
model: "suppose the set C = {a, b, c} is the set of all cats. … The algebraic
closure of C is written *C and is the set {a, b, c, a⊕b, b⊕c, a⊕c, a⊕b⊕c}."

On what plurals denote: "In most mereological approaches to the semantics of
count nouns, a plural count noun denotes the algebraic closure of the set
denoted by its singular form." The worksheet's plural morpheme -s = λP.∗P is the
*inclusive* variant: "On the inclusive view, the plural form of a count noun
denotes its algebraic closure (Krifka, 1986; Sauerland, 2003 …)".

Two definite articles. Their (27): "Definition Supremum of a set P: sup(P) = ιz
[P(z) ∧ ∀x[P(x) → x ≤ z]]", introduced "Following a proposal of Montague (1973)
… (cf. Krifka 1986)". The worksheet's theSUP is exactly (27). theSUM is Sharvy's
generalised-sum article; on cumulative sets they agree: "the cats would refer to
⊕cat = a⊕b⊕c, the sum of all cats."

## 3 Measured plurals

Their (25): "Definition Atomic number: atoms(x) = card({y | y ≤ x ∧ atom(y)}).
(The atomic number of x is the cardinality of the set of atoms that are part of
x.)" Then: "With this, we can interpret two cats as {x | *cat(x) ∧ atoms(x) =
2}, which can be shown to be a quantized set". For the definite: "For a
non-cumulative set like {x | x∈*C ∧ atoms(x) = 2}, the supremum exists only if
it is a singleton set … hence, only if there are exactly two cats. This captures
the intuitive meaning of the two cats."

## 4 Sums of predicates

Quoted in full: "Mereological notions have been applied to predicates to model
certain cases of conjunction, as in the girls sang and danced, which is true if
some of the girls sang and the other girls danced. Link (1983) proposed to lift
sum formation to predicates. Take *S and *D to be the set of singers and
dancers; then sang and danced denotes the set {x⊕y | x∈*S ∧ y∈*D}."

Rendering note: the worksheet's second *and*, λQ.λP.λz.∃x∃y[z = x⊕y ∧ P(x) ∧
Q(y)], is that set comprehension written as a λ-term.

Omitted from the worksheet: Link's separate mass/count domains and the
materialisation homomorphism, his distributivity operator, and the
individual/group distinction; see Champollion & Krifka (2016, §§2–3) for the
full picture.
